# Wall of Things
Wall of Things was created by me, Tyler Jiang, and was the first web app I ever completed and deployed.

The frontend was designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap while the backend was built using Django with the help of Hello Web App. The messages on the wall are stored in a database using PostgreSQL.
